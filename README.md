This is a Python program that extracts data from PDF files in a specified folder, stores it in a Pandas DataFrame, and then writes the data to a CSV file. The program uses PyMuPDF, a Python binding for the MuPDF rendering engine, to read and extract data from the PDF files.

The program starts by specifying the year of the folder path and defining the columns for the DataFrame. It then initializes an empty DataFrame with the specified columns.

The process_pdf() function is defined to extract data from a PDF file and append it to the DataFrame. The function uses regular expressions to extract data such as the date, national preparedness level, initial attack activity, new large incidents, large fires contained, uncontained large fires, area command teams committed, NIMOs committed, type 1 IMTs committed, type 2 IMTs committed, and complex IMTs committed.

The folder_path variable is defined to specify the path of the folder containing the PDF files to be processed. The program then iterates over all the PDF files in the folder and calls the process_pdf() function on each file to extract the required data and append it to the DataFrame.

After all the PDF files have been processed, the resulting DataFrame is printed to the console. The program then defines a csv_folder_path variable to specify the path of the folder where the CSV file will be written. If the folder does not exist, the program creates it.

The program extracts the year from the folder path using regular expressions, generates a CSV file name with the year and the current date, and generates the full file path by joining the CSV file name with the CSV folder path. The program then writes the DataFrame to the CSV file using the to_csv() function with the index=False parameter to exclude the index column from the CSV file.
